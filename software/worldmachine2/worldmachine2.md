# World Machine 2
## Texturing a terrain
Terrains are easy to make in WM, but to give them a texture is slightly more difficult.

Open up WM and remove the terrace and add Erosion

Use the Classic WM Erosion setting for best results

Use the [Coastal Overlay Macro](http://www.world-machine.com/library/index.php?entry=47&focus=1) to create a texure. (Note: [This](![](software/worldmachine2/CoastalOverlay.dev) macro has been edited to output many types of maps)

This is what the macro looks like when you enter the macro.

Add Bitmap and Heightmap file outputs. Use PNGs and name according to what it is. (Note: Check off output on every build to quickly create the files by just building)

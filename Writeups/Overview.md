# CSC CTF Write-ups

### What are Write-ups?

CTF write-ups are detailed step-by-step solutions for a challenge. They also include methodology, rationale, references, and tools used. Reading these write-ups is a great way to learn about concepts that you could not figure out or see other ways of accomplishing the same tasks. At CSC, we encourage your team to complete write-ups for every challenge you team solves that is 400 or more points. These write-ups will be available for club members after their respective challenges close.

### Submitting a Write-up

If you have completed a challenge valued at 400 or more points, you can send CSC a write-up. Write-ups should be a word document or a PDF. Be sure to also include the challenge files (if the challenge had a downloadable file) and any programs you created. Also, remember that write-ups are a set of instructions for others to follow. They must be clear and replicable. If you have any questions, feel free to ask or use other write-ups as templates.

<h3>History</h3>
		<p>Google started with two students from Stanford and it grew quickly. The first server that they used for their search engine was mounted with Legos as they wanted the cheapest possible method. The team went from garage to office and eventually to the Googleplex. Google has had some notable employee projects which stem from their rule that 20% of an employee's time is spent working on personal projects. These projects include Gmail which was launched on April Fool's Day. Google has taken to buy many startups and therefore they are expanding rapidly in many fields such as robotics and AI. Google's large field of expertise is something that worries the EU and many countires are limiting Google's dominance in many markets. Google has a huge patent portfolio and recently large tech companies have taken to acquiring patents rather than creating new ones for new ideas because they want to sue and counter sue each other. Google today stands with a firm hold on technology and mobile operation systems.</p>

<h3>Future</h3>
<p>Obviously, no one can predict the future, but Google has been slowly increasing it's patent portfolio and it's revenue stream. Google is poised to dominate the mobile platform if it can shrink Tizen OS's future. In the ad space, many companies have stopped trying to compete with Google because of the waste of effort. The hot topic for Google right now is how it can predict what is the next big market. Many people suppose it will be wearables, but we will need to wait and see how Android Wear does.</p>
